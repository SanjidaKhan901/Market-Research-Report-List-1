<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dairy Spiral Pasteurizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li> Direct Steam Heating</li><li>Indirect Steam Heating </li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Dairy Spiral Pasteurizer market is segmented into two main types: direct steam heating and indirect steam heating. Direct steam heating injects steam directly into the milk, rapidly raising its temperature, ensuring efficient pasteurization. In contrast, indirect steam heating uses a heat exchanger to transfer heat without contact between the steam and milk, providing a gentler pasteurization process. Both methods aim to effectively eliminate harmful microorganisms in dairy products while maintaining their quality and flavor.</p></p>
