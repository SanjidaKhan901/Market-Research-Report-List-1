<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Microgrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid-Tied</li><li>Independent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The solar microgrid market comprises two primary types: grid-tied and independent systems. Grid-tied microgrids are connected to the main electricity grid and can sell excess energy back or draw power during low production. They optimize costs and reliability through this integration. Independent microgrids, on the other hand, operate autonomously, typically in remote areas without grid access. They ensure energy self-sufficiency and resilience, often relying on renewable sources to meet local energy needs while enhancing energy security.</p></p>
