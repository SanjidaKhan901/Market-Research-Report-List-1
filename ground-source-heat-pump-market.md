<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ground Source Heat Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Exchange (DX)</li><li>Closed Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ground source heat pump market comprises three main types: Direct Exchange (DX), Closed Loop, and Open Loop systems. </p><p>DX systems circulate refrigerant directly in the ground, providing efficient heating and cooling but requiring careful installation. Closed Loop systems use a sealed loop of fluid, either horizontally or vertically buried underground, ensuring stable temperatures. Open Loop systems draw groundwater directly, using it for heat exchange, but depend on water availability and quality. Each type offers distinct benefits and applications in energy efficiency.</p></p>
