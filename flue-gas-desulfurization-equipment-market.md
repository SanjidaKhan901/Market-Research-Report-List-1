<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flue-gas Desulfurization Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet FGD</li><li>Dry & Semi-Dry FGD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) equipment comprises three primary types: wet, dry, and semi-dry systems. Wet FGD employs a liquid absorbent, typically limestone or lime, to remove sulfur dioxide from flue gases, resulting in a gypsum byproduct. Dry FGD utilizes a powder absorbent, such as hydrated lime, to capture sulfur dioxide without moisture. Semi-dry FGD combines aspects of both wet and dry systems, using a spray process to produce a dry residue while removing pollutants effectively. Each type offers distinct operational and environmental benefits.</p></p>
