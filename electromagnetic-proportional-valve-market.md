<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electromagnetic Proportional Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-acting Type</li><li>Pilot-operated Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electromagnetic proportional valve market can be divided into two main types: direct-acting and pilot-operated. Direct-acting valves utilize an electromagnetic coil to directly control the fluid flow, making them suitable for low-flow applications and compact systems. In contrast, pilot-operated valves employ a smaller pilot valve to manage a larger main valve, offering higher flow rates and pressure capabilities. Each type serves distinct applications, with direct-acting valves favored for precision in smaller systems, while pilot-operated valves are preferred for larger, more demanding environments.</p></p>
