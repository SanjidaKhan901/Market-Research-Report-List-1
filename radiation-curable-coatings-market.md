<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiation Curable Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>UV-Curable</li><li>Electron Beam Curable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiation-curable coatings are advanced surface treatments that solidify upon exposure to specific energy sources. UV-curable coatings use ultraviolet light to initiate a photochemical reaction, forming a durable, fast-curing finish. Electron beam (EB) curable coatings rely on high-energy electrons to polymerize the coating, offering deep penetration and suitability for heat-sensitive substrates. Both types provide eco-friendly, low-VOC solutions, with UV curing being cost-effective for thin films and EB curing excelling in thicker, complex applications. These technologies are widely used in industries like packaging, automotive, and electronics.</p></p>
