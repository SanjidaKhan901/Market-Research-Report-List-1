<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Removal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist Removal</li><li>Negative Photoresist Removal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The photoresist removal market segments into two main types based on the photoresist characteristics: positive and negative photoresist removal. Positive photoresist removal involves using solvents or chemical solutions that dissolve areas exposed to light, facilitating the etching or coating process in semiconductor and PCB manufacturing. Conversely, negative photoresist removal targets materials that harden upon exposure to light, requiring more aggressive techniques or solvents to eliminate unexposed areas. Both methods are crucial for achieving precision in microfabrication and lithography applications.</p></p>
