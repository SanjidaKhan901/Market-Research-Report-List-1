<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neuro Endoscopic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Endoscopes</li><li>Flexible Endoscopes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The neuro endoscopic market comprises two primary types: rigid endoscopes and flexible endoscopes. Rigid endoscopes are characterized by their inflexible structure, allowing for precise visualization and access to specific anatomical areas in neurosurgery. They are typically used for procedures like tumor resections and biopsies. In contrast, flexible endoscopes feature a bendable design, enabling access to more complex, curved pathways within the brain. This versatility is crucial for minimally invasive surgeries, enhancing patient recovery and reducing complications.</p></p>
