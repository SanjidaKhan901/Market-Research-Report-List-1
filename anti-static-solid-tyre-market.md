<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anti-Static Solid Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stick Tire</li><li>Non-stick Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The anti-static solid tyre market primarily consists of two main types: stick tires and non-stick tires. Stick tires are designed to create more friction with surfaces, enhancing traction and preventing slippage, making them suitable for high-performance applications. Non-stick tires, on the other hand, are engineered to minimize materials' adherence, reducing debris buildup and improving mobility in environments prone to contamination. Both types serve vital roles in industries such as warehousing, manufacturing, and logistics, where static electricity and surface grip are critical considerations.</p></p>
