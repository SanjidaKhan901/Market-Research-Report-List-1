<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Satellite Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Satellite Sensor</li><li>Passive Satellite Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The satellite sensor market is divided into two primary types: active and passive sensors. Active satellite sensors emit their own signals, such as radar or light, and measure the reflected response from the Earth's surface, allowing for detailed imaging regardless of daylight or weather conditions. In contrast, passive satellite sensors detect natural radiation emitted from the Earth, such as sunlight reflected off surfaces, requiring ambient light to function effectively. Both types are crucial for applications like environmental monitoring, mapping, and disaster management.</p></p>
