<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Mode Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pressure mode neonatal ventilators market is divided into two main types: invasive and non-invasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators involve placing a tube into the infant's airway, providing direct respiratory support, often used in more severe cases requiring accurate control of breathing parameters. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver support through masks or nasal prongs, promoting gentler respiratory assistance, suitable for less critical conditions. Both types aim to improve the respiratory function of neonates while minimizing complications.</p></p>
